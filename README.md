# Saken
MUD based style game of old, single player. WIP, not a finished game but does run!

Requirements:
+ PyQt 5+
+ Python 3+
+ Tested on OSX, Windows 7/10

The purpose of this game is to practice programming in python 3, PyQt 5, and many other things like learning about multiprocessing pipes. 
Obviously things can be done better and more efficiently, but with the learning goals in mind this is the way I accomplished it.

The reason for text based instead of video graphics is that I've always had a fascination with these style of games despite being ultra nerdy :D
