# Saken
MUD based style game of old, single player. WIP, not a finished game but does run!

Requirements:
+ PyQT 5+
+ Python 3+
+ Tested on OSX, Windows 7/10

The purpose of this game to is practice programming in python 3, PyQT, and many other things like learning about multiprocessing pipes. 
Obviously things can be done better and more efficiently, but with the learning goals in mind this is the way I accomplished it.
